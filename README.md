# 💠 React App - textUtils 🖥️

🖱️ React apps are constructed from reusable components, which are self-contained pieces of code that manage their own state and rendering logic. [React](https://react.dev/) lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like `Thumbnail`, `LikeButton`, and `Video`. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

## 💻 About React ⌨️

📖 People love web and native apps for different reasons. React lets you build both web apps and native apps using the same skills. It leans upon each platform’s unique strengths to let your interfaces feel just right on every platform. 

📑 With React, you can be a web and a native developer. Your team can ship to many platforms without sacrificing the user experience. Your organization can bridge the platform silos, and form teams that own entire features end-to-end.

## 🤔 About this App 🗿

❖ It is a general purpose Web App, that is used in order to make changes to the text and copy it for further different uses.

❖ It will be useful for the beginners and also for the people who're learning react in future and for upcoming gen.

❖ This particular react app have its own different implementation regarding hosting over to the Github and I don't need to mention the steps as those are already mentioned in the official documentation of react.

❖ This react App again is just a trial over to the projects and getting over to the data on learning different structures of React Based Application.
